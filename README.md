Introduction
Case Study: Maximising the number of Annual members for the Company's future growth
About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.  

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.   Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.  

Stakeholders and Team  
Lily Moreno: Director of Marketing  

Marketing Analytics Team: Team responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data.  

Cyclistic Executive Team: The notoriously detailed-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.  

The steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act  
ASK  
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:  

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?  
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?  
  
What is the problem you are trying to solve?  
Business Objective:  
Understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. This would help to convert casual riders to annual members and hence maximize the number of annual memberships.  
PREPARE  
Cyclistic’s historical trip data for the past 12 months, from May-2021 to Apr-2022 is used to analyze and identify trends.The data can be accessed <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>  

This is public data that can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.  

The data-privacy issues prohibit from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that we won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes. This ensures data integrity.  
  
PROCESS AND ANALYZE  
Data has been provided in 12 csv file. I've used R to process and analyse the data, as seen in the following lines of code. I've combined the 12 csv files into a single csv file and performed exploration, cleaning and analysis of the data.  
  
Futher ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT  
I've used Tableau to further analyse the data through visualisations and create a Tableau story to share my insights, findings, and recommendations.
